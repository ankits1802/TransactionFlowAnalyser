# **App Name**: TransactionFlow Analyzer

## Core Features:

- Transaction Input Interface: User interface for entering and editing transaction schedules with syntax highlighting and error checking.
- Conflict Graph Visualization: Displaying conflict graphs to show dependencies between transactions with node dragging and cycle highlighting.
- Schedule re-ordering: Employ a generative AI tool to automatically reorder operations into a conflict-serializable schedule and display them to the user.
- Lock Simulation View: Step-by-step execution view to trace lock acquisitions, releases, and deadlock scenarios in real-time.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#4682B4), evoking trust and reliability, suitable for a technical application.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F8FF), a desaturated hue of the primary, provides a neutral backdrop that won't distract.
- Accent color: Yellow-green (#9ACD32) highlights key interactive elements, chosen as an analog of blue on the color wheel, with high contrast for visibility.
- Use clear and modern sans-serif font for code snippets and transaction operations to enhance readability.
- Use minimalist icons for operations (read, write, commit, abort) to keep interface clean.
- Employ a modular card-based layout for easy arrangement of features.
- Use subtle animations for conflict graph cycle highlights.
